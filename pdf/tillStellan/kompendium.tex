\nosection{Preface}The present edition of this compendium is 
intended to be a complement to the textbook
``Engineering Mechanics''
by J.L. Meriam and L.G. Kraige (MK) for the course
"Mekanik F del 2" given in the first year of the Engineering physics
(Teknisk fysik) programme
at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg.

Apart from what is contained in MK, this course also encompasses
an elementary understanding of analytical mechanics, especially
the Lagrangian formulation. In order not to be too narrow, this
text contains not only what is taught in the course, 
but tries to give a somewhat more
general overview of the subject of analytical mechanics.
The intention is that an interested student should be able to
read additional material that may be useful in more advanced courses
or simply interesting by itself.

The chapter on the Hamiltonian formulation is strongly
recommended for the student who wants
a deeper theoretical understanding of the subject and is very
relevant for the connection between classical mechanics ("classical"
here denoting both Newton's and Einstein's theories) and
quantum mechanics.

The mathematical rigour is kept at a minimum, hopefully for the
benefit of physical understanding and clarity.
Notation is not always consistent with MK; in the cases it differs our
notation mostly conforms with generally accepted conventions.

The text is organised as follows: In \Chapter1 a background is given. 
Chapters {\old2}, {\old3} and {\old4} 
contain the general setup needed for the Lagrangian
formalism. In \Chapter5 Lagrange's equations are derived and \Chapter6
gives their interpretation in terms of an action. Chapters {\old7} and 
{\old8} contain
further developments of analytical mechanics, namely the Hamiltonian
formulation and a Lagrangian treatment of constrained systems. 
Exercises are given at the end of each chapter. 
Finally, a translation table
from English to Swedish of some terms used is found.

Many of the exercise problems are borrowed from material by Ture
Eriksson, Arne Kihlberg and G\"oran Niklasson. The selection of
exercises has been focused on \Chapter5, which is of greatest use for
practical applications.

\section\Introduction{Introduction}In Newtonian mechanics, 
we have encountered some different
equations for the motions of objects of different kinds.
The simplest case possible, a point-like particle moving
under the influence of some force, is governed by the
vector equation %$m\a=\F$, or more fundamentally,
$${d{\vec p}\over dt}=\vec F\komma\Eqn\Fma$$
where $\vec p=m\vec v$.
This equation of motion can not be {\it derived} from some other
equation. It is {\it postulated}, \ie, it is taken as an "axiom",
or a fundamental truth of Newtonian mechanics (one can also
take the point of view that it {\it defines} one of the three
quantities $\vec F$, $m$ (the inertial mass) and $\vec a$ in terms of the
other two).

Equation (\Fma) is the fundamental equation in Newtonian mechanics.
If we consider other situations, \eg\ the motion of a rigid
body, the equations of motion
$${d{\vec L}\over dt}=\vec\tau\Eqn\rigidem$$
can be obtained from it by imagining
the body to be put together of a great number of small, approximately
point-like, particles whose relative positions are fixed (rigidity
condition). If you don't agree here, you should go back and
check that the only {\it dynamical} input in eq. (\rigidem) is eq. (\Fma).
What more is needed for eq. (\rigidem) is the {\it kinematical}
rigidity constraint and suitable definitions for the angular
momentum $\vec L$ and the torque $\torq$.
We have also seen eq. (\Fma) expressed in a variety of forms obtained
by expressing its components in non-rectilinear bases (\eg\ polar 
coordinates). Although
not immediately recognisable as eq. (\Fma), these obviously 
contain no additional information, but just represent a choice
of coordinates convenient to some problem.
Furthermore, we have encountered the principles of energy, momentum
and angular momentum, which tell that under certain conditions some of these
quantities (defined in terms of masses and velocities, \ie, {\it kinematical})
do not change with time, or in other cases predict the rate at which
they change. These are also consequences of eq. (\Fma) or its
derivates, \eg\ eq. (\rigidem). Go back and check how the equations
of motion are integrated to get those principles! It is very relevant
for what will follow.

Taken all together, we see that although a great variety of different
equations have been derived and used, they all have a common root, the
equation of motion of a single point-like particle.
The issue for the subject of analytical mechanics is to put all
the different forms of the equations of motion applying in all
the different contexts on an equal footing. In fact, they will
all be expressed as the same, identical, (set of) equation(s), Lagrange's
equation(s), and, later, Hamilton's equations. In addition, these equations 
will be {\it derived} from a fundamental principle, the {\it action principle},
which then can be seen as the fundament of Newtonian mechanics (and
indeed, although this is beyond the scope of this presentation, of a
much bigger class of models, including \eg\ relativistic mechanics and
field theories).

We will also see one of the most useful and important properties of
Lagrange's and Hamilton's equations, namely that they take the same form
independently of the choice of coordinates. This will make them
extremely powerful when dealing with systems whose degrees of freedom
most suitably are described in terms of variables in which Newton's
equations of motion are difficult to write down immediately, and
they often dispense with the need of introducing forces
whose only task is to make kinematical conditions fulfilled, such
as for example the force in a rope of constant length ("constrained
systems"). We will give several examples of these types of
situations.\endpage

\section\GenCoords{Generalised coordinates}A most 
fundamental property of a physical system is its number
of {\it degrees of freedom}. This is the minimal number of variables
needed to completely specify the positions of all particles and
bodies that are part of the system, \ie, its {\it configuration}, at a
given time.
If the number of degrees of freedom
is $N$, any set of variables $q^1,\ldots,q^N$ specifying the
configuration is called a set of {\it generalised coordinates}. Note
that the manner in which the system moves is not included in the
generalised coordinates, but in their time derivatives $\dot
q^1,\ldots,\dot q^N$. 

\example{A point particle moving on a line has one degree of freedom.
A generalised coordinate can be taken as $x$, the coordinate along
the line. A particle moving in three dimensions has three degrees
of freedom. Examples of generalised coordinates are the usual
rectilinear ones, $\vec r=(x,y,z)$, and the spherical ones,
$(r,\theta,\phi)$, where $x=r\sin\theta\cos\phi$,
$y=r\sin\theta\sin\phi$, $z=r\cos\theta$.}

\example{A rigid body in two dimensions has three degrees of freedom ---
two ``translational'' which give the position of some specified
point on the body and one ``rotational'' which gives the orientation
of the body. An example, the most common one, of generalised coordinates
is $(x_c,y_c,\phi)$, where $x_c$ and $y_c$ are rectilinear components
of the position of the center of mass of the body, and $\phi$ is the
angle from the $x$ axis to a line from the center of mass to another
point $(x_1,y_1)$ on the body.}

\example{A rigid body in three dimensions has six degrees of freedom.
Three of these are translational and correspond to the degrees of freedom
of the center of mass. The other three are rotational and give the
orientation of the rigid body. We will not discuss how to assign
generalised coordinates to the rotational degrees of freedom (one way
is the so called Euler angles), but the number should be clear from the
fact that one needs a vector ${\vec\omega}$ with three components
to specify the rate of change of the orientation.}

The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of equations
of motion one needs to find the motion of the system. Sometimes
it is suitable to use a larger number of coordinates than the
number of degrees of freedom for a system. Then the coordinates
must be related via some kind of equations, called constraints.
The number of degrees of freedom in such a case is equal to the
number of generalised coordinates minus the number of constraints.
We will briefly treat constrained systems in \Chapter8.

\example{The configuration of a mathematical pendulum can be specified
using the rectilinear coordinates $(x,y)$ of the mass with the
fixed end of the string as origin. A natural generalised coordinate,
however, would be the angle from the vertical. The number of degrees 
of freedom is only one, and $(x,y)$ are subject to the constraint
$x^2+y^2=l^2$, where $l$ is the length of the string.} 

In general, the generalised coordinates are chosen according to
the actual problem one is interested in. 
If a body rotates around a fixed axis, the most natural choice for
generalised coordinate is the rotational angle. If something moves
rectilinearly, one chooses a linear coordinate, \etc\ For 
composite systems, the natural choices for generalised coordinates
are often mixtures of different types of variables, of which linear
and angular ones are most common. 
The strength of the Lagrangian
formulation of Newton's mechanics, as we will soon see, is that
the nature of the generalised coordinates is not reflected in
the corresponding equation of motion. The way one gets to the equations
of motion is identical for all generalised coordinates.

{\it Generalised velocities} are defined from the generalised coordinates
exactly as ordinary velocity from ordinary coordinates:

$$v^i=\dot q^i\komma\quad i=1,\ldots,N\punkt\Eqn\genveloc$$

Note that the dimension of a generalised velocity depends
on the dimension of the corresponding generalised coordinate,
so that \eg\ the dimension of a generalised velocity for an
angular coordinate is $(\hbox{time})^{-1}$ --- it is an angular velocity.
In general, $(v^1,\ldots,v^N)$ is not the velocity vector (in an
orthonormal system).

\example{With polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$ as generalised coordinates,
the generalised velocities are $(\dot r,\dot\phi)$, while the 
velocity vector is $\dot r\hat r+r\dot\phi\hat\phi$.}

\section\GenForces{Generalised forces}Suppose we have a system 
consisting of a number of point particles
with (rectilinear) coordinates $x^1,\ldots,x^N$, and that the configuration of
the system also is described by the set of generalised coordinates
$q^1,\ldots,q^N$. (We do not need or want to specify the
number of dimensions the particles can move in, \ie, the number of
degrees of freedom per particle. This may be coordinates for $N$
particles moving on a line, for $n$ particles on a plane, with $N=2n$,
or for $m$ particles in three dimensions, with $N=3m$.) 
Since both sets of coordinates specify
the configuration, there must be a relation between them:
$$\eqalign{	x^1&=x^1(q^1,q^2,\ldots,q^N)=x^1(q)\komma\cr
		x^2&=x^2(q^1,q^2,\ldots,q^N)=x^2(q)\komma\cr
		&\vdots\cr
		x^N&=x^N(q^1,q^2,\ldots,q^N)=x^N(q)\komma\cr}
			\Eqn\coordrel$$
compactly written as $x^i=x^i(q)$. To make the relation between the two
sets of variable specifying the configuration completely general,
the functions $x^i$ could also involve an explicit time dependence.
We choose not to include it here. The equations derived in \Chapter5
are valid also in that case.
If we make a small (infinitesimal) displacement $dq^i$ in the variables $q^i$,
the chain rule implies that the corresponding displacement in $x^i$ is 
$$dx^i=\sum_{j=1}^N{\*x^i\/\*q^j}dq^j\punkt\Eqn\displacerel$$
The infinitesimal work performed by a force during such a displacement
is the sum of terms of the type $\vec F\cdot d\vec r$, \ie,
$$dW=\sum_{i=1}^NF_idx^i=\sum_{i=1}^N\Q_idq^i\komma\Eqn\workrel$$
where $\Q$ is obtained from eq. (\displacerel) as 
$$\Q_i=\sum_{j=1}^NF_j{\*x^j\/\*q^i}\punkt\Eqn\genforcedef$$
$\Q_i$ is the {\it generalised force} associated to the generalised 
coordinate $q^i$. As was the case with the generalised velocities,
the dimensions of the $\Q_i$'s need not be those of ordinary forces.

\vfill\eject

\example{Consider a mathematical pendulum with length $l$, the 
generalised coordinate being $\phi$, the angle from the vertical.
Suppose that the mass moves an angle $d\phi$ under the influence 
of a force $\vec F$. The displacement of the mass is
$d\vec r=ld\phi\hat\phi$ and the infinitesimal work becomes 
$dW=\vec F\cdot d\vec r=F_\phi ld\phi$. 
The generalised force associated with the angular
coordinate $\phi$ obviously is $\Q_\phi=F_\phi l$, which is exactly
the torque of the force.}

The conclusion drawn in the example is completely general --- the generalised
force associated with an angular variable is a torque. 

If the force is conservative, we may get it from a potential $V$ as
$$F_i=-{\*V\/\*x^i}\punkt\Eqn\potforce$$
If we then insert this into the expression 
(\genforcedef) for the generalised force, we get
$$\Q_i=-\sum_{j=1}^N{\*V\/\*x^j}{\*x^j\/\*q^i}=-{\*V\/\*q^i}
				\punkt\Eqn\consgenforce$$
The relation between the potential and the generalised force looks
the same whatever generalised coordinates one uses.

\exer{A thin rod of length $2\ell$ moves in three dimensions. As

\section\KinEn{Kinetic energy and generalised momenta}We will examine 
how the kinetic energy depends on the generalised
coordinates and their derivatives, the generalised velocities.
Consider a single particle with mass $m$ moving in three dimensions, 
so that $N=3$ in the description of the previous chapters.
The kinetic energy is
$$\K=\half m\sum_{i=1}^3(\dot x^i)^2\punkt\Eqn\rectikin$$
Eq. (\displacerel) in the form
$$\dot x^i=\sum_{j=1}^3{\*x^i\/\*q^j}\dot q^j\Eqn\velocityrel$$
tells us that $\dot x^i$ is a function of the $q^j$'s, the $\dot q^j$'s and
time (time enters only if the transition functions (\coordrel) involve
time explicitly). We may write the kinetic energy in terms of the
generalised coordinates and velocities as
$$\K=\half m\sum_{i,j=1}^3A_{ij}(q)\dot q^i\dot q^j\Eqn\generkin$$
(or in matrix notation $\K=\half m\dot q^tA\dot q$),
where the symmetric matrix $A$ is given by
$$A_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^3{\*x^k\/\*q^i}{\*x^k\/\*q^j}\punkt\Eqn\kinmatrix$$
It is important to note that although the relations between the
rectilinear coordinates $x^i$ and the generalised coordinates $q^i$
may be non-linear, the kinetic energy is always a bilinear form in
the generalised velocities with coefficients ($A_{ij}$) that depend
only on the generalised coordinates.

\example{We look again at plane motion in polar coordinates. The relations
to rectilinear ones are
$$\eqalign{	&x=r\cos\phi\komma\cr
		&y=r\sin\phi\komma\cr}\Eqn\rectipolarrel$$
so the matrix $A$ becomes (after a little calculation)
$$A=\left[\matrix{	A_{rr}	&A_{r\phi}\cr
			A_{r\phi}&A_{\phi\phi}\cr}\right]
	=\left[\matrix{	1	&0\cr
			0	&r^2\cr}\right]\komma\Eqn\polarkinmatrix$$
and the obtained kinetic energy is in agreement with the well known
$$\K=\half m(\dot r^2+r^2\dot\phi^2)\punkt\Eqn\polarkinetic$$}

If one differentiates the kinetic energy with respect to one of the
(ordinary) velocities $v^i=\dot x^i$, one obtains
$${\*\K\/\*\dot x^i}=m\dot x^i\komma\Eqn\diffkinwrtv$$
\ie, a momentum. The {\it generalised momenta} are defined in the analogous 
way as
$$p_i={\*\K\/\*\dot q^i}\punkt\Eqn\genmomentumdef$$
Expressions with derivatives with respect to a velocity, like
$\*\/\*\dot x$, tend to cause some initial confusion, since there
``seems to be some relation'' between $x$ and $\dot x$. A good advice is
to think of a function of $x$ and $\dot x$ (or of any generalised
coordinates and velocities) as a function of $x$ and $v$ (or to think
of $\dot x$ as a different letter from $x$). The
derivative then is with respect to $v$, which is considered as a
variable completely 
unrelated to $x$.

\example{The polar coordinates again. Differentiating $\K$ of 
eq. (\polarkinetic) with respect to $\dot r$ and $\dot\phi$ yields
$$p_r=m\dot r\komma\quad p_\phi=mr^2\dot\phi\punkt\Eqn\polargenmomenta$$
The generalised momentum to $r$ is the radial component of the ordinary
momentum, while the one associated with $\phi$ is the angular momentum,
something which by now should be no surprise.}

The fact that the generalised momentum associated to an angular variable
is an angular momentum is a completely general feature.

We now want to connect back to the equations of motion, and formulate
them in terms of the generalised coordinates. This will be done in the 
following chapter.

\endpage

\exercises\noindent The generalised coordinates introduced in Chapters
{\old2} and {\old3} were fixed relative to an inertial system,
i.e. the coordinate transformation  
(\coordrel) did not depend explicitly on time. But time dependent coordinate
transformations, \ie, moving generalised coordinates, can also be
used. 
What is needed is that the kinetic energy is the kinetic energy
relative to an inertial system. 
In this case expressions (\displacerel) for displacements, and (\workrel) for
generalised work, will contain additional terms with the time
differential $dt$. But these terms do not affect the definition of
generalised force. 
Equation (\genforcedef), defining generalised force, is unchanged, except it
should be specified that the partial derivatives must be evaluated at
fixed time. Use this fact in some of the exercises below.

\section\LagrEq{Lagrange's equations}
\vskip-2\baselineskip
\subsection\SinglePart{A single particle}The equation of motion
of a single particle, 
as we know it so far, is given by eq. (\Fma).
We would like to recast it in a form that is possible to generalise
to generalised coordinates. Remembering how the momentum was obtained
from the kinetic energy, eq. (\genmomentumdef), we rewrite (\Fma) in the form
$${d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot x^i}=F_i\punkt\Eqn\prellagreqn$$
A first guess would be that this, or something very similar, holds
if the coordinates are replaced by the generalised coordinates and
the force by the generalised force. We therefore calculate the left hand
side of (\prellagreqn) with $q$ instead of $x$ and see what we get:
$$\eqalign{{d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot q^i}&=
    \sum_{j=1}^3{d\/dt}\left({\*\K\/\*\dot x^j}{\*\dot x^j\/\*\dot q^i}\right)=
    \sum_{j=1}^3{d\/dt}\left({\*\K\/\*\dot x^j}{\*x^j\/\*q^i}\right)=\cr
    &=\sum_{j=1}^3\left({\*x^j\/\*q^i}{d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot x^j}+
               {d\/dt}{\*x^j\/\*q^i}{\*\K\/\*\dot x^j}\right)=
    \sum_{j=1}^3\left({\*x^j\/\*q^i}{d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot x^j}+
               {\*\dot x^j\/\*q^i}{\*\K\/\*\dot x^j}\right)=\cr
    &=\sum_{j=1}^3{\*x^j\/\*q^i}{d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot x^j}+
               {\*\K\/\*q^i}\punkt\cr}\Eqn\lagrhaerledn$$
Here, we have used the chain rule and the fact that $\K$ depends on $\dot x^i$
and not on $x^i$ in the first step. Then, in the second step, we use the
fact that $x^i$ are functions of the $q$'s and not the $\dot q$'s to
get ${\*\dot x^j\/\*\dot q^i}={\*x^j\/\*q^i}$. The fourth step uses this 
again to derive ${d\/dt}{\*x^j\/\*q^i}={\*\dot x^j\/\*q^i}$, and the last
step again makes use of the chain rule on $\K$. Now we can insert the
form (\prellagreqn) for the equations of motion of the particle:
$${d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot q^i}=\sum_{j=1}^3{\*x^j\/\*q^i}F_j+{\*\K\/\*q^i}
    \komma\Eqn\onthewaytolagr$$
and arrive at Lagrange's equations of motion for the particle:
$${d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot q^i}-{\*\K\/\*q^i}=\Q_i\punkt\Eqn\lagreqns$$
\endpage
\example{A particle moving under the force $\vec F$ using rectilinear
coordinates. Here one must recover the known equation $m\vec a=\vec F$.
Convince yourself that this is true.}
\example{To complete the series of examples on polar coordinates, we
finally derive the equations of motion. From \polarkinetic, we get
$$\matrix{{\*\K\/\*\dot r}=m\dot r\komma\hfill
		&{\*\K\/\*r}=mr\dot\phi^2\komma\hfill\cr
          {\*\K\/\*\dot\phi}=mr^2\dot\phi\komma\hfill
		&{\*\K\/\*\phi}=0\punkt\hfill\cr}
                     \Eqn\dKdpolar$$
Lagrange's equations now give 
$$\eqalign{&m(\ddot r-r\dot\phi^2)=F_r\komma\cr
           &m(r^2\ddot\phi+2r\dot r\dot\phi)=\tau\,\,
		(=rF_\phi)\punkt\cr}
                        \Eqn\polarlagrangeEq$$
}

The Lagrangian formalism is most useful in cases when there is a potential
energy, \ie, when the forces are conservative and mechanical energy is
conserved. Then the generalised forces can be written as
$\Q_i=-{\*V\/\*q^i}$ and Lagrange's equations read
$${d\/dt}{\*\K\/\*\dot q^i}-{\*\K\/\*q^i}+{\*V\/\*q^i}=0\punkt\Eqn\conslagreqns$$
The potential $V$ can not depend on the generalised velocities, so
if we form 
$$L=\K-V\komma\Eqn\thelagrangian$$
the equations are completely expressible in terms of $L$:
$$
{d\/dt}{\*L\/\*\dot q^i}-{\*L\/\*q^i}=0
\Eqn\TheMostUsefulForm$$
The function $L$ is called the {\it Lagrange function} or the {\it Lagrangian}.
This form of the equations of motion is the one most often used
for solving problems in analytical 
mechanics. There will be examples in a little while.
    
\example{Suppose that one, for some strange reason, wants to
solve for the motion of a particle with mass $m$ moving in a harmonic
potential with spring constant $k$ using the generalised coordinate
$q=x^{1/3}$ instead of the (inertial) coordinate $x$.
In order to derive Lagrange's equation for $q(t)$, one first has to
express the kinetic and potential energies in terms of $q$ and $\dot q$.
One gets $\dot x={\* x\/\* q}\dot q=3q^2\dot q$ and thus
$\K={9m\/ 2}q^4\dot q^2$. The potential is $V=\half kx^2=\half kq^6$,
so that $L={9m\/ 2}q^4\dot q^2-\half kq^6$. Before writing down
Lagrange's equations we need 
${\* L\/\* q}=18mq^3\dot q^2-3kq^5$ and 
${d\/ dt}{\* L\/\*\dot q}=
 {d\/ dt}\left(9mq^4\dot q\right)=
   9mq^4\ddot q+36mq^3\dot q^2$. Finally,
$$\eqalign{0&={d\/ dt}{\* L\/\*\dot q}-{\* L\/\* q}=\cr
			&=9mq^4\ddot q+36mq^3\dot q^2-18mq^3\dot q^2+3kq^5=\cr
   &=9mq^4\ddot q+18mq^3\dot q^2+3kq^5=\cr
    &=3q^2\left(3mq^2\ddot q+6mq\dot q^2+kq^3\right)\cr}
         \punkt\Eqn\stupid$$
If one was given this differential equation as an exercise in mathematics,
one would hopefully end up by making the change of variables $x=q^3$,
which turns it into 
$$m\ddot x+kx=0\komma\Eqn\nonstupid$$
which one recognises as the correct equation of motion for the
harmonic oscillator.}

The example just illustrates the fact that
Lagrange's equations give the correct result for any choice of
generalised coordinates. This is certainly not the case for Newton's
equations. If $x$ fulfills eq. (\nonstupid), it certainly doesn't imply
that any $q(x)$ fulfills the same equation!

The derivation of Lagrange's equations above was based on a situation
where the generalised coordinates $q^i$ are ``static'', \ie, when the
transformation (\coordrel) between $q^i$ and inertial coordinates $x^i$ does not
involve time. This assumption excludes many useful situations, such
as linearly accelerated or rotating coordinate systems. However, it turns out
that Lagrange's equations still hold in cases where the transformation
between inertial and generalised coordinates has an explicit time
dependence, $x^i=x^i(q;t)$. The proof of this statement is left as an
exercise for the theoretically minded student. It involves generalising
the steps taken in eq. (\lagrhaerledn) to the situation where the
transformation also involves time. We will instead give two examples
to show that Lagrange's equations, when applied in time-dependent
situations, reproduce well known inertial forces, and hope that this
will be as convincing as a formal derivation.

The only thing one has to keep in mind when forming the Lagrangian, is
that the kinetic energy shall be the kinetic energy relative an inertial system.

The first example is about rectilinear motion in an accelerated frame,
and the second concerns rotating coordinate systems.

\example{Consider a particle with mass $m$ moving on a line. Instead
  of using the 
  inertial coordinate $x$, we want to using $q=x-x_0(t)$, where
  $x_0(t)$ is some (given) function. (This could be \eg\ for the
  purpose of describing physics inside a car, moving on a straight
  road, where $x_0(t)$ is the inertial position of the car.) 
We also define $v_0(t)=\dot x_0(t)$ and $a_0(t)=\ddot x_0(t)$. 
The kinetic energy is
$$
T=\half m\left(\dot q+v_0(t)\right)^2\punkt\eqn
$$
In the absence of forces, one gets Lagrange's equation
$$
0={d\/dt}{\*T\/\*\dot q}=m(\ddot q+a_0(t))\punkt\Eqn\LinearAcc
$$
We see that the well known inertial force $-ma_0(t)$ is automatically
generated. If there is some force acting on the particle, we note that
the definition of generalised force tells us that $\Q_q=F_x$. The
generalised force $\Q_q$ does not include the inertial force; the
latter is generated from the kinetic energy as in eq. (\LinearAcc).
} 

\example{
Let us take a look at particle motion in a plane using a rotating
coordinate system. For simplicity, let the the rotation vector be
constant and pointing in the $z$ direction, $\vec\omega=\omega\hat
z$. The relation between inertial and rotating coordinates is
$$
\left\{\matrix{
x=\xi\cos\w t-\eta\sin\w t\cr
y=\xi\sin\w t+\eta\cos\w t\cr
}\right.\eqn
$$
and the inertial velocities are
$$
\left\{\matrix{
\dot x=\dot\xi\cos\w t-\dot\eta\sin\w t
             -\w(\xi\sin\w t+\eta\cos\w t)\cr
\dot y=\dot\xi\sin\w t+\dot\eta\cos\w t
             +\w(\xi\cos\w t-\eta\sin\w t)\cr
}\right.\eqn
$$
We now form the kinetic energy (again, relative to an inertial frame),
which after a short calculation becomes
$$
T=\half m\left[\dot\xi^2+\dot\eta^2+2\w(\xi\dot\eta-\eta\dot\xi)
         +\w^2(\xi^2+\eta^2)\right]\punkt\eqn
$$
Its derivatives with respect to (generalised) coordinates and
velocities are
$$
\eqalign{
p_\xi={\*T\/\*\dot\xi}&=m(\dot\xi-\omega\eta)\komma\cr
p_\eta={\*T\/\*\dot\eta}&=m(\dot\eta+\omega\xi)\komma\cr
{\*T\/\*\xi}&=m(\w\dot\eta+\w^2\xi)\komma\cr
{\*T\/\*\eta}&=m(-\w\dot\xi+\w^2\eta)\punkt\cr
}\eqn
$$
Finally, Lagrange's equations are formed:
$$
\eqalign{
0&={d\/dt}{\*T\/\*\dot\xi}-{\*T\/\*\xi}=m(\ddot\xi-\omega\dot\eta)
                                -m(\w\dot\eta+\w^2\xi)
            =m(\ddot\xi-2\omega\dot\eta-\w^2\xi)\komma\cr
0&={d\/dt}{\*T\/\*\dot\eta}-{\*T\/\*\eta}=m(\ddot\eta+\omega\dot\xi)
                                -m(-\w\dot\xi+\w^2\eta)
            =m(\ddot\eta+2\omega\dot\xi-\w^2\eta)\punkt\cr
}\eqn
$$
Using vectors for the relative position, velocity and acceleration:
$\vec\varrho=\xi\hat\xi+\eta\hat\eta$, 
$\vec v_{\rm rel}=\dot\xi\hat\xi+\dot\eta\hat\eta$ and 
$\vec a_{rel}=\ddot\xi\hat\xi+\ddot\eta\hat\eta$, we rewrite
Lagrange's equations as
$$
0=m\left[\vec a_{rel}+2\vec\w\times\vec v_{rel}
+\vec\w\times(\vec\w\times\vec\varrho)\right]\punkt
$$
The second term is the Coriolis acceleration, and the third one the
centripetal acceleration. Note that the centrifugal term comes from
the term $\half m\w^2(\xi^2+\eta^2)$ in the kinetic energy, which can
be seen as (minus) a ``centrifugal potential'', while the Coriolis
term comes entirely from the velocity-dependent 
term $m\w(\xi\dot\eta-\eta\dot\xi)$ in $T$.

\subsection\ManyDegs{Lagrange's equations with any number 
of degrees of freedom}In a more general case, 
the system under consideration can be any
mechanical system: any number of particles, any number of rigid
bodies etc. The first thing to do is to determine the number of degrees
of freedom of the system. In three dimensions, we already know that
a particle has three translational degrees of freedom and that a 
rigid body has three translational and three rotational ones.
This is true as long as there are no kinematical constraints that
reduce these numbers. Examples of such constraints can be that a 
mass is attached to the end of an unstretchable string, that a body
slides on a plane, that a particle is forced to move on the surface
of a sphere, that a rigid body only may rotate about a fixed axis,...

Once the number $N$ of degrees of freedom has been determined, one tries
to find the same number of variables that specify the configuration
of the system, the "position". Then these variables are {\it generalised
coordinates} for the system. Let us call them $q^1,q^2,\ldots,q^N$.
The next step is to find an expression for the kinetic and potential
energies in terms of the $q^i$'s and the $\dot q^i$'s (we confine
to the case where the forces are conservative --- for dissipative forces
the approach is not as powerful). Then the Lagrangian is formed as
the difference $L=\K-V$. The objects $p_i={\* L\/\*\dot q^i}$ are called
{\it generalised momenta} and $v^i=\dot q^i$ {\it generalised velocities} (if
$q^i$ is a rectilinear coordinate, $p_i$ and $v^i$ coincide with the ordinary
momentum and velocity components).
Lagrange's equations for the systems are 
$${d\/ dt}{\* L\/\*\dot q^i}-{\* L\/\* q^i}=0
    \komma\quad\quad i=1,\ldots,N\komma\Eqn\lagrgen$$
or, equivalently,
$$\dot p_i-{\* L\/\* q^i}=0\punkt\Eqn\lagrgeni$$
We state these equations without proof. The proof is completely along
the lines of the one-particle case, only that some indices have
to be carried around. Do it, if you feel tempted!

In general, the equations (\lagrgen) lead to a system of $N$ coupled
second order differential equations. We shall take a closer look
at some examples.%\vskip5cm

\example{A simple example of a constrained system is the
"mathematical pendulum", consisting of a point mass moving under the 
influence of
gravitation and attached to the end of a massless unstretchable string whose
other end is fixed at a point. 
If we consider this system in two dimensions, the
particle moves in a plane parametrised by two rectilinear coordinates that we
may label $x$ and $y$. The number of degrees of freedom here is not
two, however. The constant length $l$ of the rope puts a constraint
on the position of the particle, which we can write as $x^2+y^2=l^2$ if
the fixed end of the string is taken as origin.
The number of degrees of freedom is {\rm one}, the original two minus
one constraint.
It is possible, but
not recommendable, to write the equations of motion using these
rectilinear coordinates. Then one has to introduce a string force
that has exactly the right value to keep the string unstretched, and
then eliminate it. A better way to proceed is to identify the single
degree of freedom of the system as the angle $\phi$ from the vertical (or
from some other fixed line through the origin). $\phi$ is now the
generalised coordinate of the system. 
In this and similar cases, Lagrange's equations provide a handy way of
deriving the equations of motion.
The velocity of the point mass is $v=l\dot\phi$, so its kinetic energy is
$\K=\half ml^2\dot\phi^2$. The potential energy is $V=-mgl\cos\phi$.
We form the Lagrangian as 
$$L=\K-V=\half ml^2\dot\phi^2+mgl\cos\phi\punkt\Eqn\pendlagr$$
We form 
$$\eqalign{&{\* L\/\*\phi}=-mgl\sin\phi\komma\cr		
	&p_\phi={\* L\/\*\dot\phi}=ml^2\dot\phi\komma\cr
           &{d\/ dt}{\* L\/\*\dot\phi}=ml^2\ddot \phi\punkt\cr}\Eqn\pendvar$$
Lagrange's equation for $\phi$ now gives
$ml^2\ddot \phi+mgl\sin\phi=0$, \ie,
$$\ddot \phi+{g\/ l}\sin\phi=0\punkt\Eqn\pendem$$
This equation should be recognised as the correct equation of motion
for the mathematical pendulum.
In the case of small oscillations, one approximates $\sin\phi\approx\phi$
and get harmonic oscillations with angular frequency $\sqrt{g/l}$.}

Some comments can be made about this example that clarifies the 
Lagrangian approach.
First a dimensional argument: the Lagrangian always has the dimension
of energy. The generalised velocity here is $v_\phi=\dot\phi$, the
angular velocity, with dimension $(\hbox{time})^{-1}$. The generalised
momentum $p_\phi$, being the derivative of $L$ with respect to
$\dot\phi$, obviously hasn't the dimension of an ordinary momentum, but
$(\hbox{energy})\times(\hbox{time})=(\hbox{mass})\times(\hbox{length})^2
   \times(\hbox{time})^{-1}=(\hbox{mass})\times(\hbox{length})\times
     (\hbox{velocity})$. This is the same dimension as an angular momentum
component (recall ``$\vec L=m\vec r\times\vec v\,$''). 
If we look back at eq. (\pendvar), 
we see that $p_\phi$ is indeed the angular momentum with respect to
the origin. This phenomenon is quite general: 
{\it if the generalised coordinate
is an angle, the associated generalised momentum is an angular momentum}.
It is not difficult to guess that the generalised force should be
the torque, and this is exactly what we find by inspecting 
$-{\* V\/\*\phi}=-mgl\sin\phi$.

}
The example of the mathematical pendulum is still quite simple.
It is easy to solve without the formalism of Lagrange, best by
writing the equation for the angular momentum (which is what Lagrange's
equation above achieves) or, alternatively, by writing the force equations
in polar coordinates. By using Lagrange's equations one doesn't have
to worry about \eg\ expressions for the acceleration in non-rectilinear
coordinates. That comes about automatically.

There are more complicated classes of situations, where the variables
are not simply an angle or rectilinear coordinates or a combination
of these. Then Lagrange's equations makes the solution much easier.
We shall look at another example, whose equations of motion are cumbersome to
derive using forces or torques, a coupled double pendulum.

\example{Consider two mathematical pendulums
one at the end of the other, with masses and lengths as indicated in the figure.
The number of degrees of freedom of this system is two (as long as the
strings are stretched), and we
need to find two variables that completely specify the configuration of
it, \ie, the positions of the two masses.
The two angles $\pa$ and $\pb$ provide one natural choice, which we will
use, although there are other possibilities, \eg\ to use instead of
$\pb$ the angle $\pb'=\pb-\pa$ which is zero when the two strings are aligned.
The only intelligent thing we have to perform now is to write down
expressions for the kinetic and potential energies, then Lagrange does
the rest of the work.
We start with the kinetic energy, which requires knowledge of the
velocities. The upper particle is straightforward, it has the speed
$v_1=\la\dot\pa$. The lower one is trickier. The velocity gets two
contributions, one from $\pa$ changing and one from $\pb$ changing.
Try to convince yourselves that those have absolute values $\la\dot\pa$
and $\lb\dot\pb$ respectively, and that the angle between them is
$\pb-\pa$ as in the figure. The first of these contributions depend on
$\pb$ being defined from the vertical, so that when only $\pa$ changes,
the lower string gets parallel transported but not turned.
Now the cosine theorem gives the square of the total speed for the
lower particle:
$${v_2}^2=\la^2\dot\pa^2+\lb^2\dot\pb^2+2\la\lb\dot\pa\dot\pb\cos(\pb-\pa)
          \komma\Eqn\vtwo$$
so that the kinetic energy becomes
$$\K=\half\ma\la^2\dot\pa^2+
\half\mb\left[\la^2\dot\pa^2+\lb^2\dot\pb^2+2\la\lb\dot\pa\dot\pb\cos(\pb-\pa)
     \right]\punkt\Eqn\doublekin$$
The potential energy is simpler, we just need the distances from the "roof"
to obtain
$$V=-\ma g\la\cos\pa-\mb
g(\la\cos\pa+\lb\cos\pb)\punkt\Eqn\doublepot$$ 
Now the intelligence is
turned off, the Lagrangian is formed as 
$L=\K-V$, and Lagrange's equations are written down.
We leave the derivation as an exercise (a good one!) and state the
result:
$$\eqalign{&\ddot \pa+{\mb\/\ma+\mb}{\lb\/\la}
      \left[\ddot \pb\cos(\pb-\pa)-\dot\pb^2\sin(\pb-\pa)\right]
          +{g\/\la}\sin\pa=0\komma\cr
      &\ddot \pb+{\la\/\lb}\left[\ddot \pa\cos(\pb-\pa)
	+\dot\pa^2\sin(\pb-\pa)\right]
          +{g\/\lb}\sin\pb=0\punkt\cr}
              \Eqn\lagrdouble$$
One word is at place about the way these equations are written. When one
gets complicated expressions with lots of parameters hanging around in
different places, it is good to try to arrange things as clearly as possible.
Here, we have combined masses and lengths to get dimensionless factors as
far as possible, which makes a dimensional analysis simple. This provides
a check for errors --- most calculational errors lead to dimensional errors!
The equations (\lagrdouble) are of course not analytically solvable.
For that we need a computer simulation. What we can obtain analytically is
a solution for small angles $\pa$ and $\pb$. We will do this calculation
for two reasons. Firstly, it learns us something about how to linearise
equations, and secondly, it tells us about interesting properties of
coupled oscillatory systems.
In order to linearise the equations, we throw away terms that are not linear
in the angles or their time derivatives. To identify these, we use the
Maclaurin expansions for the trigonometric functions. The lowest order
terms are enough, so that $\cos x\approx 1$ and $\sin x\approx x$.
The terms containing $\dot\pa^2$ or $\dot\pb^2$ go away (these can be seen
to represent centrifugal forces, that do not contribute when the strings
are approximately aligned or the angular velocities small). The linearised
equations of motion are thus
$$\eqalign{&\ddot \pa+{\mb\/\ma+\mb}{\lb\/\la}\ddot \pb+{g\/\la}\pa=0\komma\cr
           &{\la\/\lb}\ddot \pa+\ddot \pb+{g\/\lb}\pb=0\punkt\cr}
		\Eqn\doublelin$$
We now have a system of two coupled linear second order differential
equations. They may be solved by standard methods. It is important to
look back and make sure that you know how that is done.
The equations can be written on matrix form
$$M\ddot \Phi+K\Phi=0\komma\Eqn\phimatrixeq$$
where
$$\Phi=\left[\matrix{\pa\cr\pb\cr}\right]\komma\quad\quad
        M=\left[\matrix{1&{\mb\/\ma+\mb}{\lb\/\la}\cr
                        \,\,{\la\/\lb}\,\,&1\cr}\right]\komma\quad\quad
        K=\left[\matrix{{g\/\la}&0\cr
                        0&{g\/\lb}\cr}\right]\punkt\Eqn\matrices$$
The ansatz one makes is $\Phi=Ae^{\pm i\o t}$ with $A$ a column vector
containing "amplitudes", which gives
$$(-M\o^2+K)A=0\punkt\Eqn\motwookaiszero$$
Now one knows that this homogeneous equation has non-zero 
solutions for $A$ only
when the determinant of the "coefficient matrix" $(-M\o^2+K)$ is zero, \ie,
the rows are linearly dependent giving two copies of the same equation.
The vanishing of the determinant gives a second order equation for $\o^2$
whose solutions, after some work (do it!), are
$$\eqalign{\o^2={g\/2\ma\la\lb}\biggl\{(&\ma+\mb)(\la+\lb)\pm\cr
     &\pm\sqrt{(\ma+\mb)\bigl[\ma(\la-\lb)^2+\mb(\la+\lb)^2\bigr]}\biggr\}
          \punkt\cr}\Eqn\omegatwodouble$$
These are the {\rm eigenfrequencies} of the system. It is generic for
coupled system with two degrees of freedom that there are two
eigenfrequencies. If one wants, one can check what $A$ is in the two cases.
It will turn out, and this is also generic, that the lower frequency
corresponds to the two masses moving in the same direction
 and the higher one to opposite directions. It is
not difficult to imagine that the second case gives a higher frequency ---
it takes more potential energy, and thus gives a higher ``spring constant''. 
What is one to do with such a complicated answer? The first thing is
the dimension control. Then one should check for cases where one knows
the answer. One such instance is the {\rm single} pendulum, \ie,
$\mb=0$. Then the expression (\omegatwodouble) should boil down
to the frequency $\sqrt{g/\la}$ (see exercise below). 
One can also use one's
physical intuition to deduce what happens \eg\ when $\ma$ 
is much smaller than
$\mb$. After a couple of checks like this one can be almost sure that the
expression obtained is correct. This is possible for virtually every problem.} 

The above example is very long and about as complicated a calculation
we will encounter. It may seem confusing, but give it some time, go
through it systematically, and you will see that it contains many
ingredients and methods that are useful to master. If you really understand
it, you know most of the things you need to solve many-variable problems
in Lagrange's formalism.

The Lagrange function is the difference between kinetic and
potential energy. This makes energy conservation a bit obscure in
Lagrange's formalism. We will explain how it comes about, but this
will become clearer when we move to Hamilton's formulation.
Normally, in one dimension, one has the equation of motion
$m\ddot x=F$. In the case where $F$ only depends on $x$, there is a 
potential, and the equation of motion may be integrated using the trick
$\ddot x=a=v{dv\/dx}$ which gives $mvdv=Fdx$, $\half mv^2-\int Fdx=C$,
conservation of energy. It must be possible to do this in Lagrange's
formalism too. If the Lagrangian does not depend on $t$, we observe that
$$\eqalign{&{d\/dt}\left[\dot x{\*L\/\*\dot x}-L(x,\dot x)\right]=\cr
	&=\ddot x{\*L\/\*\dot x}+\dot x{d\/dt}{\*L\/\*\dot x}-
		\dot x{\*L\/\*x}-\ddot x{\*L\/\*\dot x}=\cr
	&=\dot x\left[{d\/dt}{\*L\/\*\dot x}-{\*L\/\*x}\right]\cr}
			\punkt\Eqn\lagrint$$
Therefore, Lagrange's equation implies that the first quantity 
in square brackets
is conserved. As we will see in \Chapter7, it is actually the
energy. In a case with more generalised coordinates, the energy takes
the form
$$E=\sum_i\dot q^i{\*L\/\*\dot q^i}-L=\sum_i\dot q^ip_i-L
	\punkt\Eqn\energylagr$$
It is only in one dimension that energy conservation can replace the
equation of motion --- for a greater number of variables it contains
less information.

\section\Action{The action principle}In this chapter 
we will formulate a fundamental principle leading
to the equations of motion for any mechanical system. It is the
{\it action principle}. In order to understand it, we need some
mathematics that goes beyond ordinary analysis, so called
functional analysis. This is nothing to be afraid of, and the
mathematical stringency of what we are doing will be minimal.

Suppose we have a mechanical system --- for simplicity we can think of
a particle moving in a potential --- and we do not yet know what
the path $\vec r(t)$ of it will be, once the initial conditions are given
(it is released at a certain time $t_0$ with given position $\vec
r(t_0)=\vec r_0$
and velocity $\vec v(t_0)=\vec v_0$).
For {\it any} path $\vec r(t)$ fulfilling the initial conditions we define
a number $S$ by
$$S=\INT\, L\komma\Eqn\actiondef$$ 
where $L$ is the Lagrangian $\K-V$.
This is the {\it action}. In the case of a single particle in a potential,
the action is 
$$S=\INT\Bigl[\half m\dot x(t)^2-V\bigl(x(t)\bigr)\Bigr]\punkt\Eqn\partaction$$


\figflow{-245pt}{180pt}{\vfill\centerline{\epsffile{Fig/functional.eps}}\vfill}
The action is a function whose argument is a function and whose
value is a number (carrying dimension (energy)$\times$(time)).
Such a function is called a {\it functional}. When the argument is
written out, we we enclose it in square brackets, \eg\ "$S\left[x(t)\right]$",
to mark the difference from ordinary functions.

The action principle now states that {\it the path actually taken by
the particle must be a stationary point of the action}. What does this
mean? Recall how one determines when an ordinary function $f(x)$ has a local
extremum. If we make an infinitesimal change $\d x$ in the argument of the
function, the function itself does not change, 
%FIGURE!!!!!
so that $f(x+\d x)=f(x)$. This is the same as saying that the derivative
is zero, since $f'(x)=\lim_{\e\rightarrow 0}{f(x+\e)-f(x)\/\e}$.
When now the function we want to ``extremise'' is a functional instead of
an ordinary function, we must in the same way demand that a small change in the
argument $\vec r(t)$ of the functional does not change the functional.
Therefore we chose a new path for the particle $\vec r(t)+\E(t)$
(we have to take $\E(t_0)=\dot\E(t_0)=0$ not to change the given initial
conditions)
which differs infinitesimally from $\vec r(t)$ at every time, and see
how the action $S$ is changed. For simplicity we consider rectilinear
motion, so that there is only one coordinate $x(t)$.
We get
$$S[x(t)+\e(t)]-S[x(t)]=\INT \left[L\bigl(x(t)+\e(t),\dot x(t)+\dot\e(t)\bigr)
             -L\bigl(x(t),\dot x(t)\bigr)\right]\punkt\Eqn\deltaS$$

\figflow{90pt}{120pt}{\vfill\noindent\centerline{\epsffile{Fig/variation.eps}}}
\vskip-2\parskip\noindent Taking $\e$ to be infinitesimally small, one
can save parts linear in  
$\e$ only, to obtain $L\bigl(x(t)+\e(t),\dot x(t)+\dot\e(t)\bigr)=
L\bigl(x(t),\dot x(t)\bigr)+\e(t){\*L\/\*x}(t)+\dot\e(t){\*L\/\*\dot x}(t)$.
Inserting this into eq. (\deltaS) gives
$$\eqalign{S[x(t)+\e(t)]-S[x(t)]
   &=\INT\left[\e(t){\*L\/\*x}(t)+\dot\e(t){\*L\/\*\dot x}(t)\right]\cr
%   =[\hbox{partial integration}]=\cr
   &=\INT\,\e(t)\left[{\*L\/\*x}(t)-{d\/dt}{\*L\/\*\dot x}(t)\right]\komma\cr}
        \Eqn\deltaSS$$
%\figflow{90pt}{160pt}{\vfill\noindent\centerline{\epsffile{Fig/variation.eps}}}
where the last step is achieved by partial integration
(some boundary term at infinity has been thrown away, but never mind).
If the path $x(t)$ is to be a stationary point, this has to vanish for all
possible infinitesimal changes $\e(t)$, which means that the entity
inside the square brackets in the last expression in eq. (\deltaSS)
has to vanish for all times. We have re-derived Lagrange's equations
as a consequence of the action principle. The derivation goes the same
way if there are more degrees of freedom (do it!).

The above derivation actually shows that Lagrange's equations are true
also for non-rectilinear coordinates. We will not present a rigorous
proof of that, but think of the simpler analog where a function of a number
of variables has a local extremum in some point. If we chose different
coordinates, the function {\it itself} is of course not affected --- the
solution to the minimisation problem is still that all derivatives
of the function vanish at the local minimum. The only difference for our
action {\it functional} is that the space in which we look for
stationary points is infinite-dimensional. (The fact that Lagrange's
equations also hold when the relation between inertial and generalised
coordinates involves time, which we chose not to prove in \Chapter5,
becomes almost obvious by this way of thinking.)

One may say a word about the nature of the stationary points. Are they
local minima or maxima? In general, they need not be either. The normal
situation is that they are ``terrace points'', comparable to the
behaviour of the function $x^3$ at $x=0$. Paths that are ``close'' to
the actual solution may have either higher or lower value of the action.
The only general statement one can make about the solution is that it
is a stationary point of the action, \ie, that an infinitesimal change
in the path gives no change in the action, analogously to the statement
that a function has zero derivative in some point. 

Analogously to the way one defines derivatives of functions,
one can define {\it functional derivatives} of functionals. A functional
derivative ${\d\/\d x(t)}$ is defined so that a change in the argument $x(t)$
by an infinitesimal function $\e(t)$ gives a change in the functional 
$F[x(t)]$:
$$F[x+\e]-F[x]=\int dt\,\e(t){\d F\/\d x(t)}\punkt\Eqn\derdef$$ 
The functional derivative of $F$
is a functional with an explicit $t$-dependence. Compare this definition
with what we did in eqs. (\deltaS) and (\deltaSS). We then see that the action
principle can be formulated as 
$${\d S\/\d x(t)}=0\Eqn\dsdxzerox$$
in much the same way as an ordinary local extremum is given by
${df\/dx}=0$. Using arbitrary generalised coordinates,
$${\d S\/\d q^i(t)}=0\punkt\Eqn\dsdxzeroq$$
Eq. (\dsdxzeroq) is Lagrange's equation.

Variational principles are useful in many areas, not only in Newtonian
mechanics. They (almost obviously) are important in optimisation
theory.
The action formulation of the dynamics of a system is the
dominating one when one formulates {\it field theories}. Elementary
particles are described by relativistic quantum fields, and their
motion and interaction are almost always described in terms of an
action.

\section\Hamilton{Hamilton's equations}When we derived Lagrange's
equations, 
the variables we used
were the generalised coordinates
$q^1,\ldots,q^N$ and the generalised velocities $\dot q^1,\ldots,\dot q^N$.
The Lagrangian $L$ was seen as a function of these, $L(q^i,\dot q^i)$.
This set of variables is not unique, and there is one other important
choice, that is connected to the {\it Hamiltonian} formulation of mechanics.
Hamilton's equations, as compared to Lagrange's equations, do not
present much, if any, advantage when it comes to problem solving
in Newtonian mechanics. Some things become clearer, though, \eg\ 
the nature of conserved quantities. Hamilton's formulation is often
used in quantum mechanics, where it leads to a complementary and 
equivalent picture to one that uses Lagrange's variables.

We depart from the Lagrangian, as defined in \Chapter5,
and define the generalised momenta corresponding to the coordinates
$q^i$ according to
$$p_i={\*L\/\*\dot q^i}\punkt\Eqn\momentumdef$$
In a rectilinear coordinate system, $p_i$ are the usual momenta,
$p_i=m\dot q^i$, but, as we have seen, this is not true
for other types of generalised coordinates.

Our situation now is that we want to change the fundamental variables 
from (generalised) coordinates $q^i$ and velocities $v^i$ to coordinates 
and momenta 
$p_i$. We will soon see that it is natural to consider an other function 
than the Lagrangian when this change of variables is performed.
To illustrate this, consider a situation with only one coordinate $q$.
The differential of the Lagrangian $L(q,v)$ is 
$$dL={\*L\/\*q}dq+{\*L\/\*v}dv={\*L\/\*q}dq+pdv\punkt\Eqn\dLone$$
In a framework where the fundamental variables are $q$ and $p$ we
want the differential of a function to come out naturally as
(something)$dq+$(something)$dp$. Consider the new function $H$ defined
by 
$$H=vp-L=\dot qp-L\punkt\Eqn\Hdef$$ 
$H$ is the {\it Hamiltonian}. Its differential is
$$dH=dvp+vdp-dL=dvp+vdp-{\*L\/\*q}dq-pdv=-{\*L\/\*q}dq+vdp
\komma\Eqn\dHone$$
so we have 
$${\*H\/\*q}=-{\*L\/\*q}\komma\quad{\*H\/\*p}=v=\dot q
\punkt\Eqn\dHdqdHdp$$
The change of function of the type (\Hdef) associated with this kind of 
change of variables as is called a {\it Legendre transform}.   
It is important here to remember that when we change variables to $q$
and $p$, we have to express the function $H$ in terms of the new variables
in eq. (\Hdef) so that every occurrence of $v$ is eliminated.
By using Lagrange's equation ${\*L\/\*q}=\dot p$ we find 
{\it Hamilton's equations} from eq. (\dHdqdHdp):
$$\dot q={\*H\/\*p}\komma\quad\dot p=-{\*H\/\*q}\punkt\Eqn\hamiltoneq$$
The many-variable case is completely analogous, one just hangs an index
$i$ on (almost) everything; the proof is almost identical.
The general form is
$$H=\sum_i\dot q^ip_i-L\komma\Eqn\Hdefi$$
$$\dot q^i={\*H\/\*p_i}\komma\quad\dot p_i=-{\*H\/\*q^i}
	\punkt\Eqn\hamiltoneq$$ 

\example{In order to understand these equations, we examine what they say
for a rectilinear coordinate, where we have $\K=\half m\dot x^2$ and
$L=\half m\dot x^2-V(x)$. Then $p={\*L\/\*{\dot x}}=m\dot x$ and
$$H=\dot xp-L={p^2\/m}-\half m({p\/m})^2+V(x)={p^2\/2m}+V(x)\komma\Eqn
	\rectham$$ 
which is
the sum of kinetic and potential energy. This statement is actually 
general (as long as there is no explicit time-dependence in $L$).
Hamilton's equations take the form
$$\dot x={\*H\/\*p}={p\/m}\komma\quad\dot p=-{dV\/dx}\punkt\Eqn\recthameq$$
We notice that instead of one second order differential equation
we get two first order ones. The first one can be seen as defining $p$,
and when it is inserted in the second one one obtains
$$m\ddot x=-{dV\/dx}\komma\Eqn\ddotxis$$
which of course is the ``usual'' equation of motion.}

Some things become very clear in the Hamiltonian framework. In particular,
conserved quantities (quantities that do not change with time) emerge
naturally. Consider, for example, the case where the Hamiltonian does not
depend on a certain coordinate $q^k$. Then Hamilton's equations immediately
tells us that the corresponding momentum is conserved, since
$\dot p_k=-{\*H\/\*q^k}=0$.

\example{For a rectilinear coordinate $q$, when the potential does not depend
on it, we obtain the conserved quantity $p$ associated with $q$. This is
not surprising --- we know that momentum is conserved in the absence 
of force.} 

\example{In polar coordinates, with a central potential, we have
$$H={1\/2m}\bigl(p_r^2+{p_\phi^2\/r^2}\bigr)+V(r)\komma\Eqn\centralH$$
which is independent of $\phi$, so that the associated momentum $p_\phi$,
the angular momentum, is conserved. This is exactly what we are used to
in the absence of torque. Note that ${p_\phi^2\/2mr^2}+V(r)$ is the
``effective potential energy'' used for motion under a central force. }

It should be mentioned that this also can be seen in Lagrange's framework ---
if the Lagrangian does not depend on $q^k$, Lagrange's equation associated
with that variable becomes ${d\/dt}{\*L\/\*\dot q^k}=0$, telling that
$p_k={\*L\/\*\dot q^k}$ is conserved.

We can also draw the conclusion that the Hamiltonian $H$ itself is conserved:
$$\dot H=\sum_i\left({\*H\/\*q^i}\dot q^i+{\*H\/\*p_i}\dot p_i\right)=
\sum_i\left({\*H\/\*q^i}{\*H\/\*p_i}
+{\*H\/\*p_i}\left(-{\*H\/\*q^i}\right)\right)=0 
	\punkt\Eqn\Hconserved$$
This states the conservation of energy, which is less direct in
Lagrange's formulation.

Finally, we will do some formal development in the Hamiltonian formalism.
Exactly as we calculated the time derivative of the Hamiltonian in
equation \Hconserved, the time derivative of any function on phase space
$A(q^i,p_i)$ is calculated as
$$\dot A=\sum_i\left({\*A\/\*q^i}\dot q^i+{\*A\/\*p_i}\dot p_i\right)=
	\sum_i\left({\*A\/\*q^i}{\*H\/\*p_i}-{\*A\/\*p_i}{\*H\/\*q^i}\right)

If one defines the {\it Poisson bracket} between two functions $A$ and $B$
on phase space as
$$\{A,B\}=\sum_i\left({\*A\/\*q^i}{\*B\/\*p_i}-{\*A\/\*p_i}{\*B\/\*q^i}\right)
	\komma\Eqn\PBdef$$
the equation of motion for any function $A$ is stated as
$$\dot A=\{A,H\}\punkt\Eqn\PBEM$$
The equations of motion for $q_i$ and $p_i$, Hamilton's equations
\hamiltoneq, are special cases of this (show it!).
The Poisson brackets for the phase space variables $q_i$ and $p_i$ are
$$\eqalign{&\{q^i,q^j\}=0\komma\cr
	&\{q^i,p_j\}=\delta^i_j\komma\cr
	&\{p_i,p_j\}=0\punkt\cr}\Eqn\fundPBs$$

This type of formal manipulations do not have much relevance to actual
problem-solving in classical mechanics. It is very valuable, though, when
analyzing the behavior of some given system in field or particle theory.
It is also a powerful tool for handling systems with constraints.
Here, it is mainly mentioned because it opens the door towards
quantum mechanics. {\it One} way of going from a classical to a quantum
system is to replace the Poisson bracket by $(-i)$ times the {\it commutator}
$[A,B]=AB-BA$. This means that one has $xp-px=-i$, position and momentum
no longer commute. The momentum can actually be represented as a
space derivative, $p=i{\*\/\*x}$. The two variables become ``operators'',
and their values can not be simultaneously given specific values, because
ordinary numbers commute. This leads to Heisenberg's ``uncertainty principle'',
stating the impossibility of performing measurements on both $x$ and $p$
simultaneously beyond a maximal precision.

\section\constraints{Systems with constraints}In quite many
applications 
it happens that one does not simply want
to minimise a certain functional, but to do it under certain conditions.
We will investigate how this is done.

\example{A mathematical pendulum is confined to move on constant
radius from the attachment point of the string. It is then easy to
choose just the angle from the vertical as a generalised coordinate and
write down the Lagrangian. Another formulation of the problem would
be to extremise the integral of the 
Lagrangian $L=\half m(\dot r^2+r^2\dot\phi^2)
+mgr\cos\phi$ under the extra {\it constraint} that $r=a$.}

In the above example, the formulation with a constraint was unnecessary,
since it was easy to find a generalised coordinate for the only degree
of freedom. Sometimes it is not so. Consider an other example.

\example{A particle (a small bead) moves in two dimensions $(x,y)$, where
$x$ is horizontal and $y$ vertical, and it slides on a track whose form
is described by a function $y=f(x)$.
A natural generalised coordinate would be the distance from one specific
point on the curve measured along the track, the $x$-coordinate, or something
else. This can all be done, but
it is easier to formulate the problem the other way:
extremise the action $S=\int dt\,L$ with $L=\half m(\dot x^2+\dot y^2)
-mgy$ under the constraint that $y=f(x)$.}

Let us turn to how these constraints are treated. We would like to have
a new action that {\it automatically} takes care of the constraint, so that
it comes out as one of the equations of motion.
This can be done as follows: we introduce a new coordinate $\l$ that
enters in the Lagrangian multiplying the constraint. The time derivative
of $\l$ does not enter the Lagrangian at all. If we call the unconstrained
Lagrangian $L_0$ and the constraint $\Phi=0$, this means that
$$L=L_0+\l\Phi\punkt\Eqn\constrL$$
The equation of motion for $\l$ then just gives the constraint:
$$0={\d S\/\d\l}=-{d\/dt}{\*L\/\*\dot\l}+{\*L\/\*\l}={\*L\/\*\l}=\Phi
		\punkt\Eqn\lambdaem$$
The extra variable $\l$ is called a {\it Lagrange multiplier}.
We can examine how this works in the two examples.
\vfill\eject

\example{For the pendulum, we get according to this scheme,
$$L=\half m(\dot r^2+r^2\dot\phi^2)+mgr\cos\phi+\l(r-a)\komma\Eqn\constrpendL$$
from which the equations of motion follow:
$$\eqalign{r\,&:\quad m(\ddot r-r\dot\phi^2)-mg\cos\phi-\l=0\komma\cr
	\phi\,&:\quad {d\/dt}(mr\dot\phi)+mgr\sin\phi=0\komma\cr
	\l\,&:\quad r-a=0\punkt\cr}\Eqn\constrpendem$$
This is not yet exactly the equations we want. By inserting the last
equation (the constraint) in the other two we arrive at
$$\eqalign{&\l=m(a\dot\phi^2+g\cos\phi)\komma\cr
	&\ddot\phi+{g\/a}\sin\phi=0\punkt\cr}\Eqn\constrpendemsimpl$$
The second of these equations is the equation of motion for $\phi$, the 
only degree of freedom of the pendulum, and the first one gives no information
about the motion, it only states what $\l$ is expressed in $\phi$.}

The pattern in the example is completely general, the equation of motion
for the Lagrange multiplier gives the constraint, and the equation of
motion for the constrained variable gives an expression for the Lagrange
multiplier in terms of the real degrees of freedom (in this case $\phi$).
Let us also examine the other example.

\example{In the same way as above, the new Lagrangian becomes
$$L=\half m(\dot x^2+\dot y^2)-mgy+\l\bigl(y-f(x)\bigr)\komma\Eqn\slideL$$
with the resulting equations of motion
$$\eqalign{x\,&:\quad m\ddot x+\l f'(x)=0\komma\cr
	y\,&:\quad m\ddot y+mg-\l=0\komma\cr
	\l\,&:\quad y-f(x)=0\punkt\cr}\Eqn\slideem$$
As before, we insert the constraint in the other equations, and get,
using ${d^2\/dt^2}f(x)={d\/dt}(\dot xf'(x))=\ddot xf'(x)+\dot x^2f''(x)\,$:
$$\eqalign{&\ddot x+{\l\/m}f'(x)=0\komma\cr
	&\ddot xf'(x)+\dot x^2f''(x)+g-{\l\/m}=0\punkt\cr}\Eqn\slideemsimpl$$
The second of these equations can be seen as solving $\l$. Inserting 
back in the first one yields
$$\ddot x+\bigl(\ddot xf'(x)+\dot x^2f''(x)+g\bigr)f'(x)=0\komma\Eqn\slideone$$
or, equivalently,
$$\ddot x+{f'(x)\/1+f'(x)^2}\bigl(g+\dot x^2f''(x)\bigr)\komma\Eqn\slidetwo$$
which is the simplest form of the equation of motion for this system, and
as far as we can get without specifying the function $f(x)$.} 
	  
There are often tricks for identifying degrees of freedom and writing
the Lagrangian in terms of them. The Lagrange multiplier method makes
that unnecessary --- one just has to use the same variational principle
as usual on a modified Lagrangian, and everything comes out automatically.

It turns out to be theoretically very fruitful to treat constrained 
systems in a Hamiltonian formalism. We will not touch upon that formulation
here.

As a last example, we will solve a (classical) mechanical problem
that is not a dynamical one. 

\example{Consider a string whose ends are fixed in
two given points. What shape will the string form? We suppose that
the string is unstretchable and infinitely flexible (\ie, it takes an
infinite amount of energy to stretch it and no energy to bend it).
It is clearly a matter of minimising the potential energy of the string,
under the condition that the length is some fixed number. The input
for calculating the potential energy is the shape $y(x)$ of the string,
so it is a functional. The principle for finding the solution must then be
$${\d V\/\d y(x)}=0\komma\Eqn\stringprinc$$
where $V[y(x)]$ is the potential energy. We need an explicit expression
for V, and also for the length, that will be constrained to a certain 
value $L$ using the Lagrange multiplier method.
The length of an infinitesimal part of the string is 
$$ds=\sqrt{(dx)^2+(dy)^2}=dx\sqrt{1+y'(x)^2}\komma\Eqn\dlength$$
so that the total length and potential energy are
$$\eqalign{&L=\int_a^bdx\sqrt{1+y'(x)^2}\komma\cr
	&V=-\rho g\int_a^bdx\,y(x)\sqrt{1+y'(x)^2}\punkt\cr}\Eqn\lengthpot$$
The technique is again to add a Lagrange multiplier term to V:
$$\eqalign{&U=\int_a^bdxu(y,y')=\cr
	&\,\,\,-\rho g\int_a^bdx\,y(x)\sqrt{1+y'(x)^2}+
	\l\left(L-\int_a^bdx\sqrt{1+y'(x)^2}\right)
	\punkt\cr}\Eqn\stringaltU$$
Exactly as we recovered Lagrange's equations from ${\d S\/\d x(t)}=0$, 
the variation of $U$ gives the equation for $y$
$${d\/dx}{\*u\/\*y'}-{\*u\/\*y}=0\punkt\Eqn\lagrlengthone$$
Since there is no explicit $x$-dependence one may use the integrated form
of the equations as described in Chapter {\old5}.{\old2},
$$0={d\/dx}\left[u-y'{\*u\/\*y'}\right]=
	{d\/dx}\left[-(\l+\rho gy)\sqrt{1+{y'}^2}+
	{(\l+\rho gy)y'^2\/\sqrt{1+{y'}^2}}\right]\punkt\Eqn\lagrlengthtwo$$
We shift $y$ by a constant value to get the new 
vertical variable $z=y+\rho g/\l$,
and equation (\lagrlengthtwo) gives
$${d\/dx}{z\/\sqrt{1+{z'}^2}}=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sqrt{1+{z'}^2}=kz
	\komma\Eqn\lagrlengththree$$
so that $z'=\pm\sqrt{k^2z^2-1}$, and
$${dx\/dz}=\pm{1\/\sqrt{k^2z^2-1}}\komma\Eqn\dxdzlength$$
with the solutions
$$x(z)+c=\pm\hbox{\rm arcosh}\,kz\komma\quad z=
	{1\/k}\cosh k(x+c)\punkt\Eqn\lengthsol$$
One may of course go back to the variable $y$ and solve for the Lagrange
multiplier $\l$, but here we are only interested in the types of curves
formed by the hanging string --- they are hyperbolic cosine curves.}

Hint: There are many ways do this. In order to employ the methods of
variational calculus and constraints, use Cartesian coordinates, put
the curve in the $z=0$ plane, and parametrise it as $\vec{r}(s)$,
$0\le s\le 1$. The length can then be expressed as
$\int|\dot{\vec{r}}|\,ds$, and the enclosed area as  
$\int\hat{z}\cdot(\vec{r}\times\dot{\vec{r}})\,ds$, where overdot
denotes $s$-derivative (show this!). Use the Lagrange multiplier
method to enforce the constraint.}
